# react-ts boilerplate

A React Typescript boiler plate

- Typescript
- React
- Webpack
- Babel
- Prettier
- Eslint
- Stylelint
- Emotion 10

*Note: This boilerplate expects that your editor will run the linting/formating
tools. Consider using something like
[ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) for Vim/NeoVim, the proper
extensions to VS Code, etc. There are some yarn scripts to run the tools.*

# How to use

1. Copy files to your own repo.
2. Edit `package.json` to suite your project.
3. Check for the dependency updates (`yarn upgrade-interactive`). Consider a PR
if there is something out of date.
